ðŸ”§ Developer Notes
Lombok's @Data annotation was initially used to generate boilerplate code like getters and setters.
However, due to configuration issues during development, manual getter and setter methods were added instead.
If Lombok is properly configured in your environment, feel free to remove the explicit getters/setters and use @Data , @RequiredArgsConstructor and @Getter/@Setter.
